            <p class="desc">Steve is a player character from the 2011 sandbox video game Minecraft. Created by Swedish
                video game developer Markus "Notch" Persson and introduced in the 2009 Java-based version, Steve is one
                of nine default player character skins available for players of contemporary versions of Minecraft.
                Steve lacks an official backstory as he is intended to be a customizable player avatar as opposed to
                being a predefined character.</p>

                debuting in the Java edition of the game in October 2022. Depending on the version of Minecraft, players
                have a choice of defaulting to either Steve or any other variant skins when creating a new account.
                However, the skin is easy to change from the game itself or website.</p>

                can destroy blocks and deal massive amounts of damage. Creepers are a major source of gunpowder as well

                players but attack those that damage it or look directly at its face. Endermen teleport to avoid water
                (which harms them), sunlight, projectiles, and some other damage sources, and they occasionally pick up
                certain blocks.</p>
